# PHP SVN ACL
PHP SVN ACL (**PHSA**) is a tool that manages Access Control Lists for one or more Subversion repositories. The auth check is done via a pre-commit hook that makes sure that the user who does the commit is allowed to do so.

This is a WIP. More information about installation and usage when it's ready.
